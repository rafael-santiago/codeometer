C o d e o m e t e r  -  the beloved programmers' ego killer
-----------------------------------------------------------

Code o'what?!
-------------

Have you ever thought about your code in terms of distance magnitudes?

This is what this silly code is about. Codeometer gives you the chance of knowing how much you already walked with your
coding skills. Depending on the given distance you can realize that you need to wake up a little and really stroll out
there or you can just discover that you still need to code a little more before thinking you are all that out there....
you know... an empirical way of disabling your '--cocky-mode'... ;)

Of course, quantity does not mean quality, but you have known at least one programmer that likes to talk things like:

OK. Let's see how much this 'a lot', 'big', 'huge' and 'marathon' means in real world terms.

I do not want to depress you, REALLY. It is only about having fun and laughing at ourselves a little. It is always healthy.

Calm down, slaughter your ego (killing it is never enough) and have fun! :)

How many kilometers has codeometer?
-----------------------------------

Only considering implementation and test files (v1), codeometer says that itself has about 6.83 km.

What are the supported platform?
--------------------------------

Until now I have written codeometer thinking about Linux, FreeBSD and Windows. Anyway is pretty simple make it run
on other platforms.

How can I get the sources files?
--------------------------------

The easiest way is as follows:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# git clone https://github.com/rafael-santiago/codeometer
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

Done!

How can I build codeometer?
---------------------------

Codeometer is a Golang project. The easiest way is as follows:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# cd codeometer/src
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# go build
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# _

If you want a more robust build with an installer and stuff. You need to install my build system called Hefesto. Hefesto is
available at <https://github.com/rafael-santiago/hefesto>. After following the steps to put Hefesto working on your system,
do the following:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# git clone https://github.com/rafael-santiago/helios
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# cd helios
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/helios# hefesto --install=go-toolset,go-dep-scanner
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/helios# cd ..
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# rm -rf helios
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# git clone https://github.com/rafael-santiago/codeometer
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# cd codeometer/src
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# hefesto
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# _

Once built, you can install codeometer by running the install build sub-task:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# hefesto --install
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# _

On Windows it is installed in C:\codeometer and the application is exported, you will be able to access it from anywhere on
command prompt. On Linux and FreeBSD codeometer is installed in /usr/local/share and /usr/local/bin, you also have a man
page.

If you want to uninstall it:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# hefesto --uninstall
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# _

If you have intentions of running a secure codeometer webserver, you can make its certificate by running the make-cert build
sub-task:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# hefesto --make-cert --server-crt=RedBard.crt --server-key=RedBarn.key
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src/codeometer/src# _

How can I  use codeometer?
--------------------------

You can use codeometer as a good and old command line tool or you can you it from your web browser.

In order to use codeometer from your command line you need to run the measure command. By default this command only expects
a file or directory path or still a url to a git repo.

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-project
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

The command measure also accepts the options: --exts, --font-size, --measures, --stats-per-file, --estimatives, --async,
--loaders-nr and --subtask-timeout.

The option --exts is where you specify which file extensions are relevant (considered as code):

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-cpp-project --exts=.cpp,.hpp,c,h
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

When --exts is not passed, all files will be relevant.

The option --font-size is the option that specifies the font size of your code. There are two: '10px' and '12px' (the default):

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-cpp-project --font-size=10px
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

The option --measures specifies which real world unit of measurement will be considered by the tool. It accepts a list that
could be contains: 'km', 'mi', 'm', 'mm'. When --measures is not passed, only kilometer measure is considered:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-go-project --measures=km,mi,m,mm
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

The option --stats-per-file when passed makes codeometer to include a measurement report for each relevant found file.
By default this individual report is disabled:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-go-project --stats-per-file
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

The option --estimatives asks codeometer to include estimatives of the measured code against the measures of famous monuments
and places. By default this estimative is not included:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-go-project --estimatives
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

The option --async asks codeometer to use a more concurrent code scanning. By default the code scanning is synchronous (one
file at a time). The option --loaders-nr works together with --async. With --loaders-nr you can indicate how many concurrent
scans will be allowed by recursion (the default is 20):

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-go-project --loaders-nr=10 --async
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

If you have been facing errors when running codeometer with --async option, try to decrease the loaders number with
--loader-nr.

The option --subtask-timeout defines the maximum duration time of a subtask executed by codeometer. Until now it is used to
avoid git cloning operations being run "forever". When not specified the default timeout is 10 minutes. The format of duration
time is a positive number followed by one of the following valid time units: ns, ms, s, m, h. If we want a timeout of one hour
and a half:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer measure --src=https://github.com/you/your-go-project --subtask-timeout=1h30m
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

Now you know all aspects about the measure command.

If you want to use codeometer as a web tool you should use httpd command. This is the easiest way of running it:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer httpd --peer-addr=127.0.0.1:8080
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

Now, all you should do is to access from your browser the address <http://127.0.0.1:8080/codeometer>.

When you specify the loopback address, only you will be able to access the server. If you want more users accessing it
besides you, inform in --peer-addr your network address.

What about a secure server? If you want it, you need to specify the certificate and key file paths with the --cert and
--key options repectively:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer httpd --peer-addr=RedBarn:8080 --cert=RedBarn.crt --key=RedBarn.key
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

The httpd command also supports the --async, --loaders-nr and --subtask-timeout.

At server-side, type CTRL + c or send a SIGTERM or SIGINT to codemometer' process thus you will gracefully exit its web server.

Now you know the entire tool. If in the future you want to a quick help give it codeometer help command a try:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer help measure
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer help httpd

In order to read the manual:

    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# codeometer man
    cockyDevel@RedBarn:~/src# _

That's it. I hope you like codeometer. Enjoy!
