Code o'what?!
-------------

Have you ever thought about your code in terms of distance magnitudes?

This is what this silly code is about. Codeometer gives you the chance of knowing how much you already walked with your
coding skills. Depending on the given distance you can realize that you need to wake up a little and really stroll out
there or you can just discover that you still need to code a little more before thinking you are all that out there....
you know... a empirical way of disabling your '--cocky-mode'... ;)
