Code o'what?!
-------------

Have you ever thought about your code in terms of distance magnitudes?

This is what this silly code is about. Codeometer gives you the chance of knowing how much you already walked with your
coding skills. Depending on the given distance you can realize that you need to wake up a little and really stroll out
there or you can just discover that you still need to code a little more before thinking you are all that out there....
you know... a empirical way of disabling your '--cocky-mode'... ;)

Of course quantity does not mean quality, but you have known at least one programmer that likes to talk thinks like:

    '- Today a have been coding a LOT!'

    '- A have write much code during all my programmer life...'

    '- This software project is really big, I have been evolving it during years...'

OK. Let's see how much this 'a lot', 'big' is in real world terms.

I do not want to depress you, REALLY. It is only about having fun and laughing at ourselves a little. It is always healthy.

Calm down, slaughter your ego (killing it never is enough) and have fun! :)
